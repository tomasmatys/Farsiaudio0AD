There is only one download option for every version, because the same mod can work across all platforms 0 A.D. can run on. This means you only need one ZIP file regardless if you are using Windows, Linux or macOS.

## Installation instructions


### Zip installation:
- Unzip the download but leave the inner archive intact.
- Place the unzipped folder into /binaries/data/mods. You'll see another folder there called 'public'.
- Launch the game and enable the mod in Options>Mod Selection. Press 'Start Mods'.
- Enjoy the mod!
